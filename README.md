- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lotosney
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT with strong focus on Web development as well as Test Automation. I have already some experience in
front end and back end development (PHP) which is around one year long. I have ssome skills in test automatisation using Cypress, as well as Seleniun (used with Java)
I know  CSS and HTMl pretty well. I know JS and  bit of React, though I do not feel proffesional in it as I am aware that I still need to learn a lot about them.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects  as a tester (preferably automating one)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Easiest way is via emai  sebastiandwojcik(at)gmail(dot)com
